### Additional Resources

#### Content Blocks
- You don't need to stick to the way Warriorfolio is designed. Designed with modularity in mind, the app offers extremely versatile code blocks, or structural components. You can make countless combinations and further customize your project. These elements are divided into: Components, Design, and Core.
#### Maintenance Mode
- Put your app in maintenance mode. You have the option to activate the contact form and your social networks;
#### Discovery Mode
- Activate this feature and you will be able to view your app while it is in maintenance mode; In addition, a stripe with the notice that Discovery Mode is enabled will be displayed at the top of your app.
  
#### Core Modules Decoupling
- You can decouple the Core modules. This means you can build your app's layout your way. By default, Warriorfolio is assembled as follows: Header, Hero Section, About You, Projects, Customers, Contact, Newsletter (Email Catcher), and Footer. If you want to create a new page, these modules will automatically be available in this order for you globally. However, you may only want the Header and Footer to be displayed. To do this, just go to App Settings > Core Modules Decoupling and disable the modules you don't want to be displayed.
