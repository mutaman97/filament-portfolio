### Introduction to Warriorfolio 2
Warriorfolio aims to be simple, fast, and effective in creating your portfolio. Arriving in its new version more robust, smarter, flexible, and with new intuitive features. Designed with a modular concept, you can easily choose the order in which your page will be assembled and displayed to the public. From a Landing Page to a complete site with separate pages, but with modules that integrate with each other, like a true LEGO, Warriorfolio 2 is the ideal tool for you who want to have a simple, fast, and effective portfolio.

Designed to be 100% managed by the Control Panel, without the need for deep technical knowledge in programming, PHP, or even in Laravel.

Feel free to contribute to the project and fork it, but don't forget to give credit to the creators of Laravel, Filament, and Livewire.

And me, of course! 😁

### Additional Resources

#### Content Blocks
- You don't need to stick to the way Warriorfolio is designed. Designed with modularity in mind, the app offers extremely versatile code blocks, or structural components. You can make countless combinations and further customize your project. These elements are divided into: Components, Design, and Core.
#### Maintenance Mode
- Put your app in maintenance mode. You have the option to activate the contact form and your social networks;
#### Discovery Mode
- Activate this feature and you will be able to view your app while it is in maintenance mode; In addition, a stripe with the notice that Discovery Mode is enabled will be displayed at the top of your app.
  
#### Core Modules Decoupling
- You can decouple the Core modules. This means you can build your app's layout your way. By default, Warriorfolio is assembled as follows: Header, Hero Section, About You, Projects, Customers, Contact, Newsletter (Email Catcher), and Footer. If you want to create a new page, these modules will automatically be available in this order for you globally. However, you may only want the Header and Footer to be displayed. To do this, just go to App Settings > Core Modules Decoupling and disable the modules you don't want to be displayed.
